# ai-observability-engine
Python backend service to orchestrate, evaluate, and log AI task execution for observability and reliability.

This project was inspired by real-world challenges encountered while building and operating applied R&D systems, where understanding system behavior, decision quality, and reliability over time is critical. The goal is to generalize those lessons into a reusable backend service for AI-enabled applications.
